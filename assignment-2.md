Assignment #2: tic-tac-toe
1) Print out an empty game grid
2) Print out a full game grid (i.e. every cell has an X or an O in it, doesn't matter which or in what order)
3) Write a simplified form of the game that displays the current grid (starting with empty) and asks the player to select which cell to put an X in. Program stops when all 9 cells are full. The program automatically fills in Xs without the player having to tell it.
4) Update simplified form where the player is asked for both which cell and which letter to enter.
5) Update #4 to check that the player entered either an X or an O
6) Update #5 to work even if the player enters lower or upper case, and fills the cell with uppercase.
7) Ask the player if they want to play again when the grid is full.
8) Update #6 to have two players, with player1 being X, but don't check for winning conditions. Update the prompt to indicate which player's turn it is.
9) Ask each player for their name and use their name instead of player1/player2 when prompting for their turn.
10) Check for vertical and horizontal winning conditions. Say which player won at the end of each game.
11) Check for diagonal winning condition.
12) Check for draw condition. Say that the game is a draw at the end of each game that ends in a draw.
13) Display the number of turns it took for the game to complete (either win or draw) at the end of each game.
14) Display number of games played vs. number of games won for each player at the end of each game.
15) Ask at the beginning if the player wants to play against the computer, and if so, player is player1. Computer randomly picks an empty square for its turn.
16) When the program ends, display the total number of games played, how many player1 won, how many player2 won, how many draws, and the average (mean) number of turns it took to complete a game.
Extra credit) Make the computer's play method more advanced than simple random picking, such as choosing to block when player1 is one cell from winning, having a strategy for which cell it starts in, and trying to win. Get as far as you can on this, it's not required.
